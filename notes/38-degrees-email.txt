Dear 38 Degrees Team,

I'm reaching out to add a new petition to your website at https://home.38degrees.org.uk. Our campaign, which can be found at https://unitethearmies.org, focuses on global environmental issues and preventing ongoing and future catastrophes.

However, when trying to create the petition, I was required to enter a UK postal code. As our organization is not based in the UK, I'm wondering if there's an alternative way to make our petition available to your UK audience.

We believe that our campaign's message - "Save the Planet" - is relevant to people all over the world, including the UK. We'd love to find a way to share our petition with your community and gather support from UK residents who share our concerns about the environment.

Could you please let me know if there's a way to accommodate our request?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards, Joni Töyrylä Save the Planet - Unite the Armies https://unitethearmies.org
